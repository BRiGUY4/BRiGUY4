				<p>This all started when I downloaded the robinhood app and noticed that the stream line of news and stock suggestions were streamlined for my individual taste; the stocks I picked and the stories I liked.</p>
				<p>I then realized that there is no community in which is free to just recieve streamlined information on the next big stock pick, that was fun and easy.</p>
				<p>This is not a webpage stating what is the next stock pick, but rather a community where suggestion of stock picks are created.</p>
				<p>Believe what you want, trust who you trust, and just remember...</p>
